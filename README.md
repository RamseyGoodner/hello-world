# hello-world
The beginning of my github journey

Making the transition from military to civilian is a lot more exciting through code. In some ways they parallel eachother. I could sit back and let the world happen. Or I could shape my own world. I am not talking about destiny here, but identity. In the military you are issued a new identity, which is hard to let go of when you become a civilian. It's hard to let go of because it requires time, creativity, grit and persistance to reform oneself into their true self.

Here goes the journey. Wish me luck!
